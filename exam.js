    The periodic table organizes all of the elements. Each box of the periodic table presents information about the atoms that comprise an element. For example, each atom of element "X" in the example box below has an atomic number of "A" and an average atomic mass of "Z". The atomic number is the number of protons per atom. The atomic mass is the mass of one atom of the element expressed in atomic mass units.

    Work is directly proportional to both force and distance, so decreasing force while increasing distance- or vice versa-results in the same amount of work. This is the idea behind simple machines. The amount of work needed to lift an object, for example, would be the same whether it is lifted straight upward or carried up a ramp. Using the ramp requires more distance, but less force. A ramp is a type of simple machine.<br><br>
    Simple machines make work easier by changing the magnitude or direction of the force needed to perform the work. That difference in force is called mechanical advantage, or MA. The equation for calculating mechanical advantage is:
